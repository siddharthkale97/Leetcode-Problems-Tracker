# Leetcode-Problems-Tracker

This repository is created to track and solve important leetcode problems. Feel free to add more questions and solutions to the repository in any language. We are currently trying to add solutions for the problems specified in the follow list. 

The list - [Blind 75 Must Do Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/)

## Rules

1. Always add the problem description at the top with in comments.
2. Explain your approach in two to five lines after the problem description.
3. Make use of comments to explain your intiution and approach.
4. Naming convention is as follows - Create a seperate folder and and name your folder as problem number followed by name of the problem without spaces - **"1TwoSum"**. The file name can be the approach or algorithm name you have choosen. You can also create subfolders as the approach name and then include code inside.
5. Please include the running time and how much faster did your code ran in comparison to others. This should be included at the end of the code in comments with appropriate title.
6. If possible add time complexity to the above comment.
7. Before a push to the repository (collaborators who have access) or a pull request. Please double check if your code passes all test cases or not.
8. If you reference code from somewhere, or watched an explanation video to solve, or have an explanation video at hand, please include the link at the bottom. If an reference is already added, only add new reference if you find **better** or **more efficient** solution. Please don't include new reference simple because you liked the explanation better.
